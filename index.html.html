    <p>My favorite bevrage is Bloom Pop. Bloom Pop is a great alternative to soda. My favorite one would have to be the Shirley Temple flavor. Its a nice low calorie prebiotic sode that only contains 3 to 4 grams of sugar. I always try to recommend it to anyone that's looking for an alternative to soda.</p>
